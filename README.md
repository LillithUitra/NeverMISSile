# NeverMISSile
Applikation that helps understand the mechanics of missiles and how they apply to targets with varying speed and sig radius in EVE Online.

This program will help you to calculate your applied DPS on the fly. There are a few things this program is not capable of/ you should be aware of.

1. The program closed after Ammo selection/ Faction selection
	If you select an ammunition that doesnt have a faction variant, but tick the checkbox for the Faction selection , the program will close as it cant find a specified Missile in its Dictionary. (For example a Javelin missile, there are no "Caldari Navy Javelin Missiles")

3. Where do i specify the specific faction?
	To calculate the applied damage the specific faction (Caldari navy, Gueristas etc) doesnt make any difference, as long as you are comparing Faction with Faction or Non-Faction with Non Faction.

This is Version 1.1 of the program and ill eventually work on it further.
Also im new to coding so be gentile, its probably a mess.

Short explanation:
Step 1: Select ammo
Step 2: Enter Speed and Sig Radius
Step 3: Is it faction ammo? (Caldari navy, Gueristas, etc) Then tick the checkbox!
Step 4: Voila! Thats your application on the target and the Percentage of your Missile DPS that will apply. (Now simply do some quick maths and youll have the exact damage, before resists, that you will cause)
